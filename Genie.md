You need a desktop or laptop, VS Code, and a stable internet connection. Keep your name and email consistent everywhere. Now start the first module.

### **The Three Phases**

Pinternship has three phases. You move through them at your speed.

**Phase 1: ViBe Learning**

Watch all the ViBe videos on MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js, and TypeScript. Watch them thoroughly, take your time, remember the concepts. When you finish all of them, Phase 1 is done and you move to Phase 2.

**Phase 2: Case Studies**

Case studies are created to help you understand the topics more deeply and you can try understanding the case studies and then can try coding the solution for particular case study. You'll get stuck which is a normal thing, do not panic, ask on cliq, revisit the videos and discuss with other's.

**Phase 3: Real Projects**

After finishing ViBe and case studies, you'll contribute to actual open-source projects that are actually transforming the education. Work with our developers, that guide you to develop the real applications. Understand the features requests, take one at a time as a challenge for yourself and try adding new feature to the specific project.
